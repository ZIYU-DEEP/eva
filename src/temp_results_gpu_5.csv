"How did skiing influence Gasperl's life beyond being a sport?
Generate according to: Fulvio Ferrari's stunning images of legendary Austrian skier, Leo Gasperl , have this month inspired a GQ photo shoot which oozes 1930s glamour. Forget eighties onesies, neon and shoulder pads - this is the style we're going for this season!
This renowned sportsman and champion ski racer was famed in the 30s and 40s for teaching royalty and nobility how to perfect 'the elegance of the turn.' Known as the 'angel of the snow,' he was at one time the fastest man on skis having broken the speed record. As well as instructing numerous royals, he was also the first coach of the Italian national ski team. He appeared in several films, wrote books on skiing, modelled ski fashion and designed his own clothing line in his hometown of Cervinia. Like many famous Alpine natives, skiing was more than just a sport for Gasperl - it was a life necessity. As a young boy, he skied to school from his parent's house in the forest, every morning!
To emulate this look you'll need to visit Ralph Lauren (jumper, sunglasses, gloves), John Smedley (rollneck), Moncler Grenoble (trousers) and James Lock & Co (cap). Take a look here at GQ's amazing vintage photo gallery for further fashion tips before you go skiing.","(0.07421875, 0.07421875, 0.078125, 0.072265625, 0.07421875)","('', '', '', '', '')","[{'content': ""How did skiing influence Gasperl's life beyond being a sport?\nGenerate according to: Fulvio Ferrari's stunning images of legendary Austrian skier, Leo Gasperl , have this month inspired a GQ photo shoot which oozes 1930s glamour.

Azure AD Graph API:**\n\n- Use the `users` resource with the `filter` parameter.\n- The `filter` parameter accepts a query string with filters based on password complexity.\n\n**3. LDAP Query:**\n\n- Use LDAP tools like `ldapsearch` or `ldapquery` to search for users whose password hashes do not meet the complexity requirements.\n\n**Steps to Query Active Directory:**\n\n1. Log in to the Active Directory console.\n2. Navigate to the Users and Computers container.\n3. Select the ""Search"" tab.\n4. Click on ""Filter"" in the search bar.\n5. Enter the following filter:\n\n```\nAccountPassword -notlike \'*[0-9]{8,20}\'\n```\n\n* `AccountPassword`: The property that stores the password.\n* `-notlike`: Specifies that the password does not match the specified pattern.\n* `[0-9]{8,20}`: The length requirement for the password, where 8 to 20 characters are required.\n\n**Example PowerShell Code:**\n\n```powershell\nGet-ADUser -Filter ""AccountPassword -notlike \'*[0-9]{8,20}\'""\n```\n\n**Note:**\n\n- The complexity requirements for passwords are typically defined in the Active Directory schema.\n- The filter expressions used in the examples above are examples, and the actual filter syntax may vary depending on the specific implementation.\n- It is recommended to enforce password complexity requirements to enhance security.', 'role': 'assistant'}]","[{'content': 'Is it possible to query active directory for users whose existing password does not meet the password complexity requirements?', 'role': 'user'}

Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Article: Photos that you might have found down the back of your sofa are now big business! In 2005, the American artist Richard Prince's photograph of a photograph, Untitled (Cowboy), was sold for $ 1, 248, 000. Prince is certainly not the only contemporary artist to have worked with so-called ""found photographs""--a loose term given to everything from discarded  prints discovered in a junk shop to old advertisements or amateur photographs from a stranger's family album. The German artist Joachim Schmid, who believes ""basically everything is worth looking at"", has gathered discarded photographs, postcards and newspaper images since 1982. In his on-going project, Archiv, he groups photographs of family life according to themes: people with dogs; teams; new cars; dinner with the family; and so on. Like Schmid, the editors of several self-published art magazines also champion   found photographs. One of _ , called simply Found, was born one snowy night in Chicago, when Davy Rothbard returned to his car to find under his wiper  an angry note intended for some else: ""Why's your car HERE at HER place?"" The note became the starting point for Rothbard's addictive publication, which features found photographs sent in by readers, such a poster discovered in our drawer. The whole found-photograph phenomenon has raised some questions. Perhaps one of the most difficult is: can these images really be considered as art? And if so, whose art? Yet found photographs produced by artists, such Richard Prince, may riding his horse hurriedly to meet someone? Or how did Prince create this photograph? It's anyone's guess. In addition, as we imagine the back-story to the people in the found photographs artists, like Schmid, have collated  , we also turn toward our own photographic albums. Why is memory so important to us? Why do we all seek to freeze in time the faces of our children, our parents, our lovers, and ourselves? Will they mean anything to anyone after we've gone? In the absence of established facts, the vast collections of found photographs give our minds an opportunity to wander freely. That, above all, is why they are so fascinating.

Prince is certainly not the only contemporary artist to have worked with so-called ""found photographs""--a loose term given to everything from discarded  prints discovered in a junk shop to old advertisements or amateur photographs from a stranger\'s family album. The German artist Joachim Schmid, who believes ""basically everything is worth looking at"", has gathered discarded photographs, postcards and newspaper images since 1982. In his on-going project, Archiv, he groups photographs of family life according to themes: people with dogs; teams; new cars; dinner with the family; and so on. Like Schmid, the editors of several self-published art magazines also champion   found photographs. One of _ , called simply Found, was born one snowy night in Chicago, when Davy Rothbard returned to his car to find under his wiper  an angry note intended for some else: ""Why\'s your car HERE at HER place?"" The note became the starting point for Rothbard\'s addictive publication, which features found photographs sent in by readers, such a poster discovered in our drawer. The whole found-photograph phenomenon has raised some questions. Perhaps one of the most difficult is: can these images really be considered as art? And if so, whose art? Yet found photographs produced by artists, such Richard Prince, may riding his horse hurriedly to meet someone? Or how did Prince create this photograph? It\'s anyone\'s guess. In addition, as we imagine the back-story to the people in the found photographs artists, like Schmid, have collated  , we also turn toward our own photographic albums. Why is memory so important to us? Why do we all seek to freeze in time the faces of our children, our parents, our lovers, and ourselves? Will they mean anything to anyone after we\'ve gone?
