figure out what size battery we need

autonomy or how many days of backup and
we're gonna figure out what size solar
array will charge that battery in a
decent amount of time so let's say we
have a laptop and it takes 120 watts and
you want to run it for five hours a day
all you have to do is multiply the
consumption by the hours that you are
using it for and so 120 multiplied by
five is 600 and so what we need is a
battery that can supply 600 watt hours
for our given load every single day but
we want to have enough time for backup
or days of autonomy so typically a good
figure is three to five days of autonomy
so what this means is if you have a

that duration of reduced power output of
