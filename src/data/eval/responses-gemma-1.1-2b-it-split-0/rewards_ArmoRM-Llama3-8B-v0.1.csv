figure out what size battery we need

we're gonna figure out what size solar
array will charge that battery in a
decent amount of time so let's say we
have a laptop and it takes 120 watts and
you want to run it for five hours a day
all you have to do is multiply the
consumption by the hours that you are
using it for and so 120 multiplied by
five is 600 and so what we need is a
battery that can supply 600 watt hours
for our given load every single day but
we want to have enough time for backup
or days of autonomy so typically a good
figure is three to five days of autonomy

"Teacher: In this task, you are given music product reviews in French language. The goal is to classify the review as ""POS"" if the overall sentiment of the review is positive or as ""NEG"" if the overall sentiment of the review is negative.
Teacher: Now, understand the problem? If you are still confused, see the following example:
Le crépuscule du Dieu . Cet enregistrement des années 70 marque incontestablement le crépuscule du génie que fut Karajan, avabnt sa satannée ère numérique. Le geste n'est pas encore machinal, on le sent vibrant et alerte. La philharmonie de Berlin langoureuse, véhémente scintille de mille feux et se pare d'une aura exceptionnelle, elle nous plonge dans un monde sombre, terrifiant, ses silences nous font frémir. Les tonmeister de la DG la capte en largueur et en profondeur et nous font ""voir"" une image sonore exceptionnelle, qu'originals a, comme ce fut le cas souvent, remasterisé avec un rare talent.
Solution: POS
Reason: The overall sentiment of the review is positive as the reviewer refers to the music piece with positive expressions such as 'vibrant', 'une image sonore exceptionnelle' etc.. Hence, the label is 'POS'.

Now, solve this instance: The Album . Le deuxième est de loin le meilleur album de ces Frenchies! Que des tubes!  Si vous aimez le downtempo, le trip-hop... N'hésiter pas!

Exercise and Weight Loss: How to make it work?
Since managing weight effectively depends on calorie balance, it makes sense that we talk about not only diet (calories in), but exercise (calories out), too.
Trying to lose weight through increased activity alone is tough to do. To lose 0.5 kg in a week’s time – strictly through exercise – you’d need to burn up an extra 500 calories a day, above and beyond your current activity level. That’s no small task. You’d need to hike uphill for an hour with a 4 to 5 kg backpack or swim laps for 90 minutes – without stopping. Trying to lose weight only through increased activity – or only by cutting your calories – won’t be nearly as effective as a combination of diet and exercise.
Cutting calories may cause your metabolic rate to drop somewhat. Your metabolic rate represents the number of calories your body burns just to keep basic processes going - and is a big part of your ‘calories out’. But your metabolic rate can dip a little when you cut back on your eating. So even though your ‘calories in’ may be lower, your ‘calories out’ can drop, too – and leave you more or less in calorie balance.
Strength training can help to increase metabolic rate. When people think ‘exercise’, they usually think aerobic exercise, like cycling, swimming or jogging. But strength training is important, too – in part because it helps to build lean body mass, which can bump up your metabolic rate and help offset the drop in calorie burn that takes place when you cut your calories.
It’s easy to make mistakes when counting calories – both in and out. People tend to overestimate the calorie cost of the exercise they do – and underestimate the number of calories they eat. Which helps explain the frustration many people feel when they’re sure they’re doing ‘everything right’ – but the scale just won’t budge.
Exercise is key to good health and anything is better than nothing. When people hear that they might need an hour or more of exercise a day to keep their weight under control, it can be a little daunting. But don’t let the numbers discourage you. Do what you can, do it regularly, and try to go a little further – or work out a little harder – each time.","(0.14453125, 0.14453125, 0.1533203125, 0.1474609375, 0.1533203125)","('', '', '', '', '')","[{'content': 'How can strength training help increase your metabolic rate?: HOME > HEALTHY LIVING > Healthy Living Articles > Keeping in Shape > Exercise and Weight Loss: How to make it work?\nExercise and Weight Loss: How to make it work?\nSince managing weight effectively depends on calorie balance, it makes sense that we talk about not only diet (calories in), but exercise (calories out), too.\nTrying to lose weight through increased activity alone is tough to do.

"Here is a passage of a fanfic I'm writing:
Running.
Alear could hear the clanking of their boots as they met the floor.
It felt like they’d been running for ages. Yet their legs didn’t ache, as if they had only just started.
Groaning.
Right, they were there too. Mindless husks that sent chills down their spine. Alear was running from them. And yet, they were also running towards them, hacking away with their sword at any that came too close. The decayed army was slowly closing in on them on all sides. Yet, Alear kept running.
Suddenly, a floating man in royal blue garb had seemingly caught up with them. He filled the empty space beside them that they didn’t know was there.
“Almost time,” he said just loud enough for Alear to hear. He wasn’t there before, but it was like he never left.
Keep running.
More ashy soldiers were getting too close for comfort. Alear prepared their blade to cut them aside. But before they could swing, a strong gust of wind swept the pursuers away. No, that wasn’t a normal gust of wind. They glanced at where it came from to find an elegant young woman shaking off wispy wind residue from her hands.
“We can handle this,” was all she said, before turning back to prepare another spell. A green apparition wielding a bow, appeared beside her, ready to assist the mage as she blew the ashy army away.
Keep running.
Alear rushed past a burly young man cloaked in vermillion and another young woman dressed in colorful clothing and beads, both beating down frigid animate armor with sword and spear respectively, as well as the assistance of their own apparitions. They said something, but Alear couldn’t quite make it out over the noise.
Doesn’t matter. Keep running.
A young blonde man then came into their view, striking down any stray opponent that stood in Alear’s way with a specter of his own.
“Keep going! You can do this!” was what Alear heard from him. He was already out of their sight before they could ask what ‘this’ was. What was Alear supposed to do? They didn’t really know, but at the same time, they knew exactly what they needed to do.
That was probably why Alear was still running. They ran pretty far, but now a door was in their way. They put their claws upon it, noticing how a ring gleamed from one of their fingers. 
They froze. 
The ring was pretty.
The ring seem to have importance Alear couldn’t recall.
The ring sparkled in the faint light.
It did not match the scaly claws it sat on.
It did not match the hideous hands that belonged to Alear.
It did not-
“Alear,”
The man beside them suddenly spoke, reeling them from their spiral. That’s right, there was still something they needed to do.
“Our final battle lies ahead,”
Alear remembered now. There was no use in dwelling on their appearance. Not until they were finished. Together with the blue phantom, they pushed the door open.
“Now. It’s time to engage.”
The two now in agreement rushed past the doors, feeling a new familiar pang of power giving them the strength to conquer their mighty foe that lies ahead.
And they were running again.
